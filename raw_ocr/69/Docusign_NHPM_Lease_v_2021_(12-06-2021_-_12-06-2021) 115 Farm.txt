# 20. INSPECTIONS: 

a. Move-In Inspection: Tenant acknowledges that the Tenant is accepting the premises in "As Is" condition with the exception of any repairs or modifications as required by law. Tenant acknowledges that Tenant has been provided a move-in inspection form to be completed and returned to Landlord within three (3) days of possession or Tenant may be responsible for damages to the property based on the Landlord's findings.
b. Move-Out Inspection: It is agreed that the move-out inspection will be made within three (3) working days after Tenant has completely vacated the premises and notified Landlord in writing. Said inspection will be conducted during normal business hours

Monday through Friday. No Move-Out Inspection will be made on holidays or weekends and utilities must be left on for this inspection. Tenant will be charged if a return visit by the Landlord is necessary due to Tenant not being completely moved out. Tenant may choose to be present during the inspection and Tenant's failure to appear shall constitute the Tenant's agreement to accept the Landlord's report as conclusive and final.
21. INSURANCE: Tenant acknowledges that the Landlord does not carry insurance, nor is responsible, to cover the Tenant's personal property or personal liability. Tenant agrees to comply with the requirements of the Landlord's present or future insurance carriers and not to permit anything to be done at or within the premises which shall cause cancellation of the Landlord's policy or increase in the current rate of insurance thereon. Tenant is responsible for any loss incurred by the Landlord due to Tenant neglect, misuse, abuse or accident caused by the Tenant. Tenant also agrees that Landlord is not responsible for loss of perishable goods should there be a mechanical failure of any appliance or equipment provided by the Landlord.

Tenant is required to maintain a renter's insurance policy at all times during occupancy. Proof of such policy must be presented to Landlord prior to move-in. Should the Landlord discover at any time during occupancy that there has been a lapse in coverage, the Landlord may obtain a policy to protect the Landlord against damages by the Tenant. Said policy does not protect the Tenant. Landlord may charge the Tenant for the cost of the policy plus a monthly administrative fee of Twenty-Five Dollars (\$25.00).
22. INDEMNIFICATION: Tenant agrees to indemnify and hold Landlord harmless from and against any and all injuries, damages, losses, suits and claims against Landlord arising out of or related to: (1) Tenant's failure to fulfill any condition of this Lease; (2) any damage or injury happening in or to Property or to any improvements there on as a result of the acts or omissions of Tenant or Tenant's family members, invitees or licensees; (3) Tenant's failure to comply with any requirements imposed by any governmental authority; (4) any judgment, lien or other encumbrance filed against Property as a result of Tenant's actions and any damage or injury happening in or about Property to Tenant or Tenant's family members, invitees or licensees (except if such damage or injury is caused by the intentional wrongful acts of Landlord); (5) failure to maintain or repair equipment or fixtures, where Landlord use their best efforts to make the necessary repairs within a reasonable time period and Tenant covenants not to sue Landlord with respect to any of the above-referenced matters. In addition to the above, Tenant agrees to hold Landlord harmless from and against Owner of the Property for not paying or keeping current with any mortgage, property taxes or home owners association fee's on the Property or not fulfilling the Owner's obligations under this Rental Agreement.
23. RIGHT TO ACCESS: The Tenant shall not unreasonably withhold consent to the Landlord or Landlord's designee to enter into the dwelling unit in order to inspect the premises; make necessary or agreed repairs, decorations, alterations, or improvements; supply necessary or agreed services; or exhibit the dwelling unit to prospective or actual purchasers, mortgagees, prospective tenants, workmen, or contractors. The Landlord or Landlord's agent may enter the dwelling unit without consent of the Tenant:
a. At any time in case of emergency including but not limited to prospective changes in weather conditions which pose a likelihood of danger to the property may be considered an emergency; and
b. Between the hours of 9:00am and 6:00pm for the purpose of providing regularly scheduled periodic services such as changing furnace or air-conditioning filters, providing termite, insect, or pest treatment, and the like, provided that the Landlord announces intent to enter to perform services; and
c. Between the hours of 8:00am and 8:00pm for the purpose of providing services requested by the Tenant and that prior to entering the Landlord announces intent to enter to perform services.

The Landlord shall not abuse the right of access or use it to harass the Tenant. Except for section 23(a), 23(b), and 23(c), the Landlord shall give the Tenant at least 24 hours notice of intent to enter and may enter only at reasonable times. The Landlord has no other right of access except; pursuant to court order, as permitted by the South Carolina Residential Landlord and Tenant Act when accompanied by a law enforcement officer at reasonable times for the purpose of service of process in ejectment proceedings, or unless the Tenant has abandoned or surrendered the premises.

24. MILITARY CLAUSE: If the Tenant is a member or becomes an active member of the Armed Forces of the United States, or is a reservist called to active duty and is stationed in the Charleston area, and shall receive permanent change of station orders out of the Charleston area or deployment of 90 days or more, Tenant may, upon presentation of a copy of said orders of transfer or deployment to the Landlord, along with thirty (30) days written notice of intent to vacate and payment of all rent to the expiration date of such written notice, and any miscellaneous charges in arrears, terminate this Rental Agreement. Normal enlistment termination or other type of discharge from Armed Forces, unless due to conditions beyond the service member's control or acceptance of government quarters is not a permanent change of station and is not justification for lease termination. Withholding knowledge of pending transfer or discharge at time of entry into this Rental Agreement voids any consideration or protection offered by this section.
25. DESTRUCTION OR DAMAGE TO PREMISES: If the dwelling unit or premises are damaged or destroyed by fire or casualty to extent that normal use and occupancy of the dwelling unit is substantially impaired, the Tenant may:
a. Immediately vacate the premises and notify the Landlord in writing within seven (7) days thereafter of Tenant's intention to terminate the Rental Agreement in which case the Rental Agreement terminates as of the date of vacating; or
b. If continued occupancy is lawful, vacate any part of the dwelling unit rendered unusable by the fire or casualty, in which case the Tenant's liability for rent is reduced in proportion to the diminution in the fair-market rental value of the dwelling unit.

Unless the fire or casualty was due to the Tenant's negligence or otherwise caused by the Tenant, if the Rental Agreement is terminated, the Landlord shall return security deposit to the Tenant with the proper accounting as required by law. Accounting for rent in the event of termination or apportionment must be made as of the date of the fire or casualty. The Landlord shall withhold from the Tenant's security deposit all damages incurred if the fire or casualty was due to the Tenant's negligence or otherwise caused by the Tenant, with proper accounting as required by law.
26. CONDEMNATION AND FORECLOSURE: Tenant hereby waives any injury, loss or damage, or claim therefore against Landlord resulting from any exercise of a power of eminent domain of all or any part of the rented premises or surrounding grounds of which they are a part. All awards of the condemning authority for the taking of land, parking areas or buildings shall belong exclusively to the Landlord. In the event substantially all of the rented premises shall be taken, this Rental Agreement shall terminate as of the date the right to possession vested in the condemning authority and rent shall be apportioned as of that date. In the event any part of the property and/or building or buildings of which the rented premises are a part (whether or not the rented premises shall be affected) shall be taken as a result of the exercise of a power of eminent domain and the remainder shall not in the opinion of the Landlord, constitute an economically feasible operating unit, Landlord may, by written notice to Tenant given within sixty (60) days after the date of taking, terminate this Rental Agreement as of a date set out in the notice not earlier than thirty (30) days after the date of the notice; rent shall be apportioned as of the termination date. If the residential unit is subject to a foreclosure proceedings or tax sale, notice of said sale does not release the Tenant from Tenant's obligations in this lease nor does it authorize the Tenant to withhold payment of rent.
27. ABSENCE, NON-USE AND ABANDONMENT: The unexplained absence of a Tenant from a dwelling unit for a period of fifteen (15) days after default in the payment of rent must be construed as abandonment of the dwelling unit. If the Tenant abandons the dwelling unit before the expiration of the Rental Agreement, it terminates as of the date of the new tenancy subject to the other Landlord's remedies. If the Landlord fails to use reasonable efforts to rent the dwelling unit at a fair rental or if the Landlord accepts the abandonment as surrender, the Rental Agreement is considered to be terminated by the Landlord as of the date the Landlord has notice of the abandonment. When a dwelling unit has been abandoned or the Rental Agreement has come to an end and the Tenant has removed a substantial portion of personal property or voluntarily and permanently terminated the utilities and has left personal property in the dwelling unit or on the premises with a fair-market value of $\$ 500$ or less, the Landlord may enter the dwelling unit, using forcible entry if required and dispose of the property.
28. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH RENTAL AGREEMENT OR FAILURE TO PAY RENT: If there is a noncompliance by the Tenant with the Rental Agreement other than nonpayment of rent or a noncompliance with Paragraphs 17 or 18 above, the Landlord may deliver a written notice to the Tenant specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and that the Rental Agreement will terminate upon a date not less than 14 days after receipt of the notice, if the breach is not remedied in 14 days .The Rental Agreement shall terminate as provided in the notice except that: If the breach is remediable by repairs or otherwise and the Tenant adequately remedies the breach before the date specified in the notice, or if such remedy cannot be completed within 14 days, but is commenced within the 14-day period and is pursued in good faith to completion within a reasonable time, the Rental Agreement shall not terminate by reason of the breach.

The Landlord may recover actual damages and obtain injunctive relief in magistrate's or circuit court without posting bond for any noncompliance by the Tenant with the Rental Agreement or Paragraphs 18 or 19 above. If the Tenant's noncompliance is willful other than nonpayment of rent, the Landlord may recover reasonable attorney's fees. If the Tenant's nonpayment of rent is not in good faith, the Landlord is entitled to reasonable attorney's fees.

If there is noncompliance by the Tenant with Paragraphs 18 or 19 above, materially affecting health and safety that can be remedied by repair, replacement of a damaged item, or cleaning and the Tenant fails to comply as promptly as conditions require in case of emergency, or within fourteen (14) days after written notice by the Landlord specifying the breach and requesting that the Tenant remedy it within that period of time, the Landlord may enter the dwelling unit and cause the work to be done in a workmanlike manner and shall in addition have the remedies available under the South Carolina Residential Landlord Tenant Act.

If there is noncompliance by the Tenant with Paragraphs 18 or 19 above materially affecting health and safety other than as set forth in the preceding paragraph, and the Tenant fails to comply as promptly as conditions require in case of emergency, or within fourteen (14) days after written notice by the Landlord if it is not an emergency, specifying the breach and requesting that the Tenant remedy within that period of time, the Landlord may terminate the Rental Agreement.
29. EARLY TERMINATION WITH NOTICE: In the event the Tenant terminates this contract prior to the conclusion of the terms in Paragraph 3 the following charges are to be paid to the Landlord to mitigate any damages suffered by the Landlord due to the early termination. Tenant agrees to pay all rent and late fees due to the Landlord for the period of time left on the lease until the Landlord has rerented the unit or the use of the premises is changed to something other than a rental. Tenant further agrees to assume cost due the Landlord resulting from Landlord's efforts to locate a new tenant or securing the residence. Fees may include but are not limited to: Advertising, Leasing Commissions, Re-Keying, Administrative Fee and Management costs owed by the Landlord due to securing a new tenant plus cleaning or any other steps taken to return the unit to marketable condition. Landlord and Tenant agree that these fees are not punitive in nature but are rather to be used to mitigate damages resulting from the early termination of the lease by the Tenant.
30. REMEDY AFTER TERMINATION: If the Rental Agreement is terminated for any cause, the Landlord has a right to possession, to collect rent, and a separate claim for actual damages for breach of the Rental Agreement, reasonable attorney's fees, collection costs, collection agency fees and court costs. Any claim not satisfied by Tenant may be turned in to the credit bureau or collection agency.
