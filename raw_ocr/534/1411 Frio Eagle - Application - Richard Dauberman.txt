## Address History

We require verifiable residence history for at least three (3) years whether you currently own or rent. Applicants are responsible for providing information including the names, addresses and phone numbers, of Landlords with the dates of tenancy for the previous 3-5 years. Rental history must be verified from unbiased sources. Home ownership will be verified from a current credit report and possibly county tax records. We can accept any military post / base housing as rental history. Any evictions within the previous 5 years will be automatic grounds for denial. Broken leases will be considered on a case-bycase basis and an additional security deposit or risk mitigation fee may be required.
*** No Address History

## Employment History

We require verifiable employment history for at least the past three (3) years. You must be a permanent employee (not temporary or probationary). If you are self-employed, retired, or not employed, we can

accept such documents as signed tax returns (2 years minimum) or bank statements, that provide proof of applicant's ability to pay the monthly rent. If military, we need a current copy of your LES. If you are active duty military, you must be on an assignment that, to the best of your knowledge, will allow you to complete an initial 12 month lease agreement.
